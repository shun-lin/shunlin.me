# DiversaTech
DiversaTech is UC Berkeley's tech consultancy. We are unique from other consulting organizations because we combine both engineering and business principles to create dynamic recommendations and strategies.
A central aspect of DiversaTechâ€™s mission is to build an inclusive community in order to foster collaboration and develop consulting skills throughout campus. Instead of rejecting applicants who do not fully meet the qualifications to be tech consultants, we have developed an educational branch of our organization that exposes students to a foundation of consulting practices and current trends in technology. We see this as a development pipeline that gives students an opportunity to apply the creative and analytical skills they learn in the classroom to real world problems. In doing this, we hope to prepare more individuals to work on our consulting projects in the future and see this as the best way to pay our skills forward.
